Preview License from Google\n\n3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, limited, revocable license to use the Preview, personally or internally within your company or organization, solely to develop applications to run on the Android platform.\n\n3.2 You agree that Google or third parties owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Preview, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the Preview. \"Intellectual Property Rights\" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights.

If you withhold consent, the information will not be collected.\n\n6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the Preview and is maintained in accordance with Google's Privacy Policy located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\n\n7.

Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.\n\n8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.\n\n9.

MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THE EVALUATION MATERIALS.\n\n9. EXPIRATION. MIPS may terminate this Agreement immediately after a breach by Recipient or otherwise at MIPS? reasonable discretion and upon five (5) business days? notice to Recipient.\n\n10. GENERAL.\n\n10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS? rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.\n\n10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.\n\n10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient?s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS? express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.\n\n10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.\n\n10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n\n10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is \"deemed\" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.\n\n10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.\n\nANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS? AND ?AS AVAILABLE?, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.\n\n10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.\n---------------------------------------\nAccept?

In that case, this License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.\n\n8. Using Google APIs\n\n8.1 Google APIs\n\n8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part) unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.\n\n8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so.\n\n9.

Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.\n\n10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.\n\n10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient?s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS? express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.\n\n10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.\n\n10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n\n10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is \"deemed\" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.\n\n10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.\n\nANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS? AND ?AS AVAILABLE?, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.\n\n10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.\n---------------------------------------\nAccept?

MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THE EVALUATION MATERIALS.\n\n9. EXPIRATION. MIPS may terminate this Agreement immediately after a breach by Recipient or otherwise at MIPS? reasonable discretion and upon five (5) business days? notice to Recipient.\n\n10. GENERAL.\n\n10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS? rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.\n\n10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.\n\n10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient?s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS? express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.\n\n10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.\n\n10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n\n10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is \"deemed\" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.\n\n10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.\n\nANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS? AND ?AS AVAILABLE?, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.\n\n10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.\n---------------------------------------\nAccept?

This Agreement does not obligate Recipient to provide MIPS with comments or suggestions regarding Evaluation Materials. However, should Recipient provide MIPS with comments or suggestions for the modification, correction, improvement or enhancement of (a) the Evaluation Materials or (b) MIPS products or processes which may embody the Evaluation Materials, then Recipient agrees to grant and hereby grants to MIPS a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense MIPS? licensees and customers, under Recipient?s Intellectual property rights, to use and disclose such comments and suggestions in any manner MIPS chooses and to display, perform, copy, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise dispose of MIPS? and its sublicensee?s products embodying such comments and suggestions in any manner and via any media MIPS chooses, without reference to the source.\n\n7. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER. MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO EVALUATION MATERIALS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE EVALUATION MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS,? WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.\n\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PROFITS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED OR ALLEGED, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, UNDER TORT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY. MIPS AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, INCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THE EVALUATION MATERIALS.\n\n9. EXPIRATION. MIPS may terminate this Agreement immediately after a breach by Recipient or otherwise at MIPS? reasonable discretion and upon five (5) business days? notice to Recipient.\n\n10. GENERAL.\n\n10.1 Controlling Law. This Agreement shall be governed by California law excluding its choice of law rules. With the exception of MIPS? rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California. Each party hereby agrees to jurisdiction and venue in the courts set forth in the preceding sentence. The parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the above courts.\n\n10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.\n\n10.3 Assignment. Recipient may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license granted or any of Recipient?s rights, obligations, or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, by way of merger (regardless of whether Recipient is the surviving entity) or acquisition, or otherwise and any attempt to do so, without MIPS? express prior written consent, shall be ineffective, null and void. MIPS may freely assign this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.\n\n10.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Recipient and MIPS and supersedes in their entirety any and all oral or written agreements previously existing between Recipient and MIPS with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended or supplemented by a writing that refers explicitly to this Agreement and that is signed or otherwise accepted by duly authorized representatives of Recipient and MIPS.\n\n10.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.\n\n10.6 Export Regulations / Export Control. Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws. An export is \"deemed\" to take place when information is released to a foreign national wherever located.\n\n10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.\n\nANY PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS ARE NON-QUALIFIED AND, AS SUCH, ARE PROVIDED ?AS IS? AND ?AS AVAILABLE?, POSSIBLY WITH FAULTS, AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.\n\n10.8 Open Source Software. In the event Open Source software is included with Evaluation Software, such Open Source software is licensed pursuant to the applicable Open Source software license agreement identified in the Open Source software comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header as indicated in the Evaluation Software. Additional detail may be available (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation. With respect to the Open Source software, nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source software license agreement.\n---------------------------------------\nAccept?
